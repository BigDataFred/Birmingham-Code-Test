Variables:

rawlfp_spk: Contains lfp and spike data along with info about sampling rate and time;

data.lfp = lfp in aribtrary units
data.spk = firing time stamps in samples 
data.time = time vector in seconds
data.fs = sampling rate of lfp

positiondata: Contains position info of rat in arena

position.x=x coordinates in arbitrary units
position.y=y coordinates in arbitrary units
position.time = time vector in seconds
position.fs = sampling rate of position (i.e. camera)
